### VALORANT

Our project is to create a website for the popular first-person shooter game, Valorant. The website will serve as a hub for players to access news, updates, gameplay guides, and community resources related to the game.

The website will be designed with a clean and modern interface, utilizing a color scheme and layout that reflects the game's branding. Navigation will be intuitive, with easy-to-use menus that allow players to quickly find what they're looking for.

We will also incorporate features such as a leaderboard, where players can track their performance and compete against others, and a forum section where players can connect with each other, ask questions, and share their experiences.

In addition to serving as a resource for existing players, the website will also be optimized for search engines, helping to attract new players to the game. We are excited to create a website that enhances the Valorant gaming experience and provides a valuable resource for the game's passionate community.
